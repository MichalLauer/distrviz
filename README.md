# distrviz

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of distrviz is to vizualize (hopefully) every distribution that
is available in the [`{distr6}`](https://github.com/xoopR/distr6)
package.

## Imlemented distributions

Currently, these distributions are supported.

## To implement

Not all distributions are yet implemented.

## Todo

List of things Iâ€™d like to implement/fix in the near future:

- properly name parameter groups
- Wald is really slow because of quantile
- fix iv javascript error on load
- Weighted kinda? works
- add `Kappa` and `Omega` parametrization to `beta`
